P.-Y. Chen, X. Peng, S. Yu, ※NeuroSim+: An integrated device-to-algorithm framework for benchmarking synaptic devices and array architectures,§ IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), 2017, San Francisco, USA.


My project focuses on improving the performance(accuracy, speed) of deeplearning based neuromorphic algorithm using devices with nonlinear weight update characteristics

Various datasets, hyperparameter tuning methods in deep learning can be experimented using the library of pytorch

Further explanation of my project will be updated
